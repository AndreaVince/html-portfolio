<h1>The Best Movies According to Andrea</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Tre uomini e una gamba</h3>
<p>
    This is one of my favourite comedy movie from the legendary trio:<br />
    Aldo, Giovanni and Giacomo.
</p>

<h3>Ip Man</h3>
<p>
    This instead, is <b>THE</b> martial arts movie that tells the life of Bruce Lee's master, Ip Man.
</p>

<h3>Coraline</h3>
<p>
    Finally, this is one of my favourite movie entirely made in stop motion,<br />
    which tells the slightly disturbing adventures of Coraline.
